            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is employed everywhere, from facial and
            speech recognition to financial forecasting and the prediction of
            new chemical compounds. One of the most popular forms of AI is
            Neuronal Networks, which have demonstrated their potential to
            revolutionise the world we live in. However, these models tend to
            require huge amounts of data for training, which may be in many
            cases difficult and/or expensive to obtain. Many physical phenomena
            are governed by well-known laws, which are typically written in the
            form of partial differential equations. In this research, we are
            aiming to make use of these known laws in order to develop Physics
            Informed Neuronal Networks (PINNs) that may reduce or even remove
            the need for training data. For example, we have recently developed
            some PINNs to predict flooding without any need for training data.
            These PINNs achieve levels of accuracy and computational cost that
            can outperform widely used, state-of-the-art numerical models, such
            as those based on Finite Volume methods.

            Interferometry is a well-established technique in the field of
            optics. However, its potential in experimental fluid mechanics has
            not been thoroughly explored. By harnessing the potential of this
            technique to detect minute changes in the refractive index of the
            sample medium, we have

            that a standard interferometer can yeild high-precision measurements
            of temperature (of about a few mK) in unsteady, convective flow, in
            a fully non-instrusive manner. These features provide this this
            state-of-the-art technique with enormous potential to significantly
            enhance experimental fluid mechanics.
